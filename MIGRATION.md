## Project Structure

   The new modular structure organizes the codebase into logical components:

```
   euchre-multiplayer/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── game/
   │   │   ├── deck.js         # Card deck management
   │   │   ├── player.js       # Player state and actions
   │   │   ├── gameLogic.js    # Core game rules and flow
   │   │   └── scoring.js      # Scoring calculations
   │   ├── server/
   │   │   ├── server.js       # Main server entry point
   │   │   ├── websocket.js    # WebSocket connection handling
   │   │   └── routes.js       # API routes and endpoints
   │   ├── utils/
   │   │   ├── logger.js       # Logging utilities
   │   │   └── config.js       # Configuration settings
   │   └── index.js            # Application entry point
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── unit/
   │   ├── integration/
   │   └── e2e/
   ├── docs/
   │   └── migration.md        # This file
   ├── package.json
   └── README.md
```

## Migration Steps

1. **Analysis:** Reviewed `server3.js` to identify logical components (game logic, networking, utilities).
2. **Planning:** Designed the new directory structure and module responsibilities.
3. **Refactoring:** Split `server3.js` into smaller files under `src/`.
4. **Testing:** Wrote unit tests for each module to ensure functionality.
5. **Integration:** Connected modules via `index.js` and verified interactions.
6. **Documentation:** Updated `migration.md` with progress and details.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual modules (e.g., `deck.js`, `gameLogic.js`) for correctness.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify that modules interact correctly (e.g., WebSocket with game logic).
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate a full game with multiple clients to ensure stability.

Tools:
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Custom scripts for E2E testing with simulated clients

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- npm v8+
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/euchre-multiplayer.git
   cd euchre-multiplayer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Access the game at `ws://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket Connection Fails:**
  - Ensure port 3000 is open and not blocked by a firewall.
  - Check server logs via `logger.js` output.

- **Game Logic Errors:**
  - Verify `gameLogic.js` is correctly imported in `index.js`.
  - Run unit tests: `npm test`.

- **Need Help?**
  - Open an issue at `https://github.com/yourusername/euchre-multiplayer/issues`.

## Migration Timeline

- **Week 1:** Analysis and planning
- **Week 2:** Refactoring and initial module creation
- **Week 3:** Testing and integration
- **Week 4:** Documentation and final testing

## Initial Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
3. Use `npm run dev` for development mode with hot reloading.

## Development Workflow

- Create a branch for changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
- Commit changes with clear messages.
- Run tests before pushing: `npm test`.
- Submit a pull request for review.

## Migration Process

The migration followed a phased approach:
- Extracted game logic into `game/` directory.
- Moved WebSocket code to `server/websocket.js`.
- Centralized utilities in `utils/`.

## Detailed Migration Guide

### Step 1: Game Logic
- Moved deck-related code to `deck.js`.
- Isolated player management in `player.js`.

### Step 2: Networking
- Separated WebSocket logic into `websocket.js`.
- Defined routes in `routes.js`.

### Step 3: Testing
- Added test cases for each module in `tests/`.

## Next Steps

- Complete remaining tests.
- Deploy to a staging environment.
- Gather feedback from users.

## Known Issues

- Occasional WebSocket disconnects under high load.
- Scoring edge case with trump cards not fully tested.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to `server3.js` by checking out the previous commit.
2. Stop the modular server and restart with the old setup.
