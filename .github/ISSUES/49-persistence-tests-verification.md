## Persistence Tests Migration Verification

### Background
We've split `persistence.unit.test.js` into smaller focused test files:
- basic.unit.test.js
- gameState.unit.test.js 
- autoSave.unit.test.js

### Verification Steps

#### Test Coverage Comparison
- [ ] Run coverage on original file:
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- test/server/persistence.unit.test.js
```
- [ ] Run coverage on new files:
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- test/server/persistence/
```
- [ ] Compare coverage reports
- [ ] Document any coverage gaps

#### Import References
- [ ] Check for imports of `persistence.unit.test.js`
- [ ] Update any references to new file structure
- [ ] Verify all imports work in test files

#### Test Execution
- [ ] Run original test file
- [ ] Run all new test files
- [ ] Verify same number of tests passing
- [ ] Check test descriptions match

#### Package.json Updates
- [ ] Update test patterns to include new directory
- [ ] Verify test scripts still work
- [ ] Add new test commands if needed

### Sign-off Checklist
- [ ] All verification steps completed
- [ ] No regressions in test coverage
- [ ] Team review completed
- [ ] Original file can be safely deleted

### Notes
Remember to:
1. Keep both old and new tests until verification is complete
2. Document any discrepancies found
3. Get team approval before deleting original file
