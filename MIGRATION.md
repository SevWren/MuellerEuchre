## Project Structure

   The new modular structure organizes the codebase into logical components:

   ```
   euchre-multiplayer/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deck.js         # Card deck management
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.js       # Player state and actions
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gameLogic.js    # Core game rules and flow
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scoring.js      # Scoring calculations
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js       # Main server entry point
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ websocket.js    # WebSocket connection handling

   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e/
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migration.md        # This file
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
   â””â”€â”€ README.md
   ```

## Migration Steps

1. **Analysis:** Reviewed `server3.js` to identify logical components (game logic, networking, utilities).
2. **Planning:** Designed the new directory structure and module responsibilities.
3. **Refactoring:** Split `server3.js` into smaller files under `src/`.
4. **Testing:** Wrote unit tests for each module to ensure functionality.
5. **Integration:** Connected modules via `index.js` and verified interactions.
6. **Documentation:** Updated `migration.md` with progress and details.

## Testing Strategy

   - **Unit Tests:** Test individual modules (e.g., `deck.js`, `gameLogic.js`) for correctness.
   - **Integration Tests:** Verify that modules interact correctly (e.g., WebSocket with game logic).
   - **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate a full game with multiple clients to ensure stability.

   Tools:
   - Jest for unit and integration testing
   - Custom scripts for E2E testing with simulated clients

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

   - Node.js v16+
   - npm v8+
   - Git

### Steps

   1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/euchre-multiplayer.git
      cd euchre-multiplayer
      ```
   2. Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
   3. Start the server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
   4. Access the game at `ws://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

   - **WebSocket Connection Fails:**
     - Ensure port 3000 is open and not blocked by a firewall.
     - Check server logs via `logger.js` output.

   - **Game Logic Errors:**
     - Verify `gameLogic.js` is correctly imported in `index.js`.
     - Run unit tests: `npm test`.

   - **Need Help?**
     - Open an issue at `https://github.com/yourusername/euchre-multiplayer/issues`.
