Objective: Refactor my project by identifying all source code files that exceed 300 lines and split them into smaller, modular files based on functional or feature-based separation.

Instructions:

1.  Scan all source code files in the project directory.
2.  For any file exceeding 300 lines, analyze the logical structure (e.g., grouped functions, components, classes, handlers, utilities).
3.  Split the file into multiple smaller files based on:
    *   Independent functions or functional groups
    *   UI components
    *   Feature-specific logic
    *   Service or utility modules
    *   API routes or handlers (if applicable)
4.  Ensure import/export consistency across the new files.
5.  Update all import paths in dependent files to match the new structure.
6.  Maintain naming conventions and readability in each new file.
7.  Output the new file structure, including a short comment at the top of each new file explaining its role.

Note: Do not remove or rename functionality. The code must remain fully functional and testable after restructuring.
