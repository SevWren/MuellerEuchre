/**
 * This configuration file is used for the jsconfig.json file in the root of the
 * project. It is used to configure the JavaScript compiler and linter for the
 * project.
 *
 * When:
 *   - This file is used during development when running the "dev" script.
 *   - It is also used by the linter when running the "lint" script.
 *
 * Why:
 *   - The configuration file is needed to tell the compiler and linter how to
 *     interpret the codebase.
 *   - It is also used to configure the linter to ignore certain files and
 *     directories.
 *
 * How:
 *   - The configuration file is imported by the jsconfig.json file in the root
 *     of the project.
 *   - The jsconfig.json file is used by the compiler and linter to interpret the
 *     codebase.
 *   - The compiler and linter will use the configuration specified in this file
 *     to compile and lint the codebase.
